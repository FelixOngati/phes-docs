Introduction
=======================================
**PHES**   is an open source solution made to support the **PEPFAR** system on similar partner reporting system based on the
**DHIS2** which is currently being used for health reporting in  Kenya.
Population Health and Environment System (PHES) is an implementation of the Kenya Program Monitoring and Evaluation System (KePMS) on a
DHIS2-like platform. It was mainly designed for reporting **Non-HIV PEPFAR** program data. Unlike KePMS, this platform is web based and
users can access a common instance all over the country. The Implementing agencies can view aggregated data for all their partners, per
partner and per site. **PEPFAR** can view data aggregated per site, per partner and per Agency.
**PHES** also extends the robust features of DHIS2 because it is based on the DHIS2 platform
