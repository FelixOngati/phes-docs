Introduction
=======================================
**KePMS** - A computerized database for the management and analysis of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Care,
Treatment and Prevention Indicators .The Kenya HIV/AIDS Program Monitoring System (KePMS) is a Microsoft Access based indicator monitoring
database for use in the management, monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs supported
by **PEPFAR**. It is designed to operate at the level of in-country implementing partners who manage program specific data and
forward it to national level where it is aggregated automatically by USG program managers. The **KEPMS** can reduce the burden of reporting
and improve the quality of data by standardizing the collection of data. The KEPMS also allows partners to monitor their own performance
and make decisions informed by the data.

**PHES**   is an open source solution made to support the **PEPFAR** system on similar partner reporting system based on the
**DHIS2** which is currently being used for health reporting in  Kenya.
Population Health and Environment System (PHES) is an implementation of the Kenya Program Monitoring and Evaluation System (KePMS) on a
DHIS2-like platform. It was mainly designed for reporting **Non-HIV PEPFAR** program data. Unlike KePMS, this platform is web based and
users can access a common instance all over the country. The Implementing agencies can view aggregated data for all their partners, per
partner and per site. **PEPFAR** can view data aggregated per site, per partner and per Agency.
**PHES** also extends the robust features of DHIS2 because it is based on the DHIS2 platform
